# Flexible CSV Editor
A simple and flexible Windows .CSV reader and editor, made around .NET / C#. The way this program structurally works is object-oriented.
<br/><br/>
The tool works as much around the .csv file as it can, it will automatically change all its labels to match column names upon opening, show the right amount of fields, etc.
This makes it a very simple, fluent looking and lightweight program/tool.

***You might need to install .NET 6.0 for this.***


# Tips
- The program automatically fills missing areas with ""
- Entries aren't saved until you click on "Change row"
- The currently edited values aren't auto-saved anywhere


# Installation
- Use one of the installers found in the releases (from V2.1)
- Unzip the folder as a portable program (V1.1 + V1.0)
- Use the source code to build your own using Visual Studio (made on VS2019)
