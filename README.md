# Tips
- The program automatically fills missing areas with 0's
- Nothing is save until you go to File -> Save (to .csv). This works both negative and positive.

# Installation
## step 1: Download
Download the zip and extract this where you want your program files to stay.
Examples: `C:\Program Files`,  `%localappdata%`, or in a local folder as a portable program.
## step 2: shortcut
If you've extracted your folder in a more hidden location (say for example ProgramFiles)
=> Right click on "CSVOpener.exe"

## step 3: Enjoy!
No more installation past this, launch the program from the shortcut or \*.exe and it should be there in seconds!
