# Flexible CSVEditor
A simple and flexible Windows .CSV reader and editor, made around .NET / C#.
<br/><br/>
The tool works as much around the .csv file as it can, it will automatically change all its labels to match column names upon opening, show the right amount of fields, etc.
This makes it a very simple, fluent looking and lightweight program/tool.

***You might need to install .NET 6.0 for this.***

# Tips
- The program automatically fills missing areas with 0's
- Nothing is save until you go to File -> Save (to .csv). This works both negative and positive.
- Choose the right comma specifier before opening (and saving!) the file. It can't corrupt the original file, but the tool will have visual glitches until you open it right.

Download the zip and extract this where you want your program files to stay.

## step 2: shortcut
If you've extracted your folder in a more hidden location (say for example ProgramFiles)

No more installation past this, launch the program from the shortcut or \*.exe and it should be there in seconds!
