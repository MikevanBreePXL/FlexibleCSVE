# Flexible CSV Editor
A simple and flexible Windows .CSV reader and editor, made around .NET / C#. The way this program structurally works is object-oriented.
<br/><br/>
The tool works as much around the .csv file as it can, it will automatically change all its labels to match column names upon opening, show the right amount of fields, etc.
This makes it a very simple, fluent looking and lightweight program/tool.

***You might need to install .NET 6.0 for this.***

# Tips
- The program automatically fills missing areas with 0's
- Nothing is saved until you go to File -> Save... (This has both it's negative and positive sides.)
- Choose the right comma specifier before opening (and saving!) the file. It can't corrupt the original file, but the tool will have visual glitches until you open it right.
